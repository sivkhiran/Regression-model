In this examination we take a gander at the vehicles dataset including various parts of car structure for 32 cars, to investigate the connection between these angles with the miles per gallon. We explicitly center around the accompanying two inquiries being is a programmed or manual transmission better for MPG and how to evaluate this MPG contrast among programmed and manual transmissions. 

To accomplish our targets we make the accompanying strides:Data preprocessing
•	Exploratory Analysis
•	Model Selection
•	Model Examination

Conclusion
The primary inquiry whether programmed or manual is better for mpg can be addressed utilizing every one of the models made as holding the various parameters steady, manual transmission expands the mpg. 

Anyway the second inquiry is somewhat hard to reply. In light of 'best' fit model, we presume that vehicles with manual transmission have 2.93 more mpg than that of programmed with p < 0.05 and R-squared 0.85. 

Residuals versus Fitted plot anyway indicates something is absent from the model which may be an issue because of a little example estimate which is 32 perceptions. Despite the fact that the end that manual has better execution regarding mpg, regardless of whether the model will git every future perception will be dubious.
